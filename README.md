# Python-challenge
Before running any code need to find your way to the current working directory in the terminal ( I was doing this in the terminal in VS code to get to the correct directory to be able to run the code; for both PyBank and PyPoll)



Project Overview:
This project illustrates the practical use of Python scripting in addressing data analysis challenges within the finance and election sectors. Through the implementation of PyBank and PyPoll challenges, this repository serves as a testament to Python's efficacy in automating financial analysis and election vote tabulation. Departing from traditional Excel-based methodologies, Python demonstrates its capability to handle substantial datasets efficiently in these real-world scenarios.

Objectives:
PyBank: The aim is to analyze financial records to derive key metrics such as total months, net total "Profit/Losses," average change in "Profit/Losses," greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits.

PyPoll: This segment modernizes the vote-counting process for a small town by leveraging Python to analyze election data. The objectives include determining the total number of votes, calculating the percentage of votes each candidate garnered, tallying the total votes received by each candidate, and ultimately identifying the election winner.

Methodology:

PyBank:
Utilized Python's CSV module to ingest the financial dataset.
Calculated essential financial metrics and displayed results in the terminal.
Exported the analysis to a text file for convenient sharing and review.
PyPoll:
Leveraged Python to parse election data and conduct comprehensive data analysis to discern voting trends.
Calculated total votes cast, votes garnered by each candidate, and determined the election winner based on popular vote.
Presented results via terminal output and exported them to a text file for reference.


Key Findings:

PyBank: Successfully identified notable financial trends throughout the specified period, shedding light on significant profit fluctuations essential for future budget planning.

PyPoll: Provided a comprehensive breakdown of election results, offering clear insights into voter preferences and the overall election outcome.

Challenges and Solutions:

Data Exporting: Initially, the scripts lacked the functionality to export terminal output to a text file, as per requirements. This issue was resolved by integrating Python's file-writing capabilities to save the analysis results externally.

Pandas Usage: While feedback highlighted the use of Pandas, not specified in the challenge instructions, the primary objectives were achieved using fundamental Python scripting techniques. Future enhancements will ensure adherence to specified requirements.

Conclusion:

This project underscores Python's adaptability in addressing diverse data challenges across various domains. Through PyBank and PyPoll, we've demonstrated Python's ability to enhance the efficiency and depth of data analysis, yielding valuable insights crucial for strategic decision-making.
